# Welcome to my Linkin Park Text Analysis Project Repository!
Here you can find all the files used for creating my data set, including:
- raw and clean text files for the lyrics of all 7 albums of Linkin Park's main discography
- a customized stopword list made specifically for this dataset
- a metadata spreadsheet containing further information about each song
- document explaining the metadata spreadsheet
- document containing live links to all 9 cleaned corpora as uploaded to Voyant Tools

All of these files are available for public use and will be updated periodically as things change for my project. If you have any questions, concerns, or want to further work on textual analysis of Linkin Park (or other artists) don't hesitate to reach out to me!
